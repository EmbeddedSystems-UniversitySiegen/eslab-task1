## Introduction

A C++ simulator that implements PID control for an inverted pendulum system.
It provides a simulation environment where the user can test and evaluate
different PID controller parameters to stabilize the inverted pendulum.

The simulator also includes an HTTP server component that allows
external control and monitoring of the simulation parameters via frontend requests.
This enables users to interact with the simulation
in real-time through a web-based interface.

## Features

- Simulates PID control of an inverted pendulum system.
- Dynamically adjustable PID controller parameters (kp, kd, ki).
- Real-time visualization and monitoring of simulation.
- HTTP server for remote control and monitoring via web interface.

## Dependencies

- CMake - For building the project .
- Boost - For HTTP server, relase version can be downloaded from [boost website](https://www.boost.org/users/download/)
- nlohmann/json - json.hpp file can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.3)

## Building the Project

### Linux

To install the simulator, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EmbeddedSystems-UniversitySiegen/eslab-task1.git
  ```

- Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd es-lab-task1
  ```

- Run the setup script to download the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh
  ```

- Navigate to the build directory:

  ```bash
  cd build
  ```

- Configure the project with CMake:

  ```bash
  cmake ..
  ```

8. Build the project:

Linux:

```bash
    make - j4
```

## Windows

Use Visual Studio to open the project and build the solution.

Make sure you have downloaded and the required dependencies and put them in the correct directories.
For boost, it should be under lib/boost and for json.hpp it should be under include/nlohmann/json.hpp

If you encounter any issues during the build process,
please check the dependencies and ensure that they are correctly installed and configured.
Make sure CMakeLists.txt is correctly configured to include the required libraries.

## Usage

To use the simulator, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the build directory where the project was built:

   ```bash
   cd es-lab-task1/build
   ```

2. Run the simulator binary:

   ```bash
   ./simulator
   ```

3. Go to [simulator frontend](https://eslab.es.eti.uni-siegen.de/eslab1/index.html)

4. Use the web interface to control and monitor the simulation parameters.
   You can start, stop, and adjust the simulation settings as needed.

5. Interact with the simulator via the web interface
   to observe the behavior of the inverted pendulum system
   under different control conditions.

Alternatively, you can run the simulator with the frontend server locally
to control and monitor the simulation via a web interface:

1. Download the frontend from [github](https://github.com/linem-davton/inverted_pendulum_frontend/releases)

2. Follow the instructions in the frontend README to start the frontend server.

- Install npm and serve package and run the serve command in the dist directory

```BASH
      npm install -g serve
      serve
```

- On Windows, runinng `serve` in powsershell may require
  the following command to be run first

```BASH
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to the frontend server address (default: `http://localhost:3000`).

By following these steps, you can run the simulator and control it
using the web interface provided by the frontend server.
